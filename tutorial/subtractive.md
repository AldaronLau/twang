# Subtractive Synthesis
Subtractive synthesis is (you guessed it!) the opposite of additive synthesis.
The fundamental idea is that you take a sound that naturally has an infinite
number of sine waves added together (lots of harmonics), and start reducing
ranges of frequencies with band-pass filters.  A bandpass filter is made of two
parts; a high-pass and a low-pass filter.  High-pass filters reduce the lower
frequencies, and let the higher frequencies pass through them unchanged.
Low-pass filters are just the opposite; the higher frequencies are reduced and
the low frequencies are left unchanged.  The means a band-pass filter reduces
any frequencies outside a band/range of frequencies.
